## Blog
Put broadly, I'm most interested in science--particularly computer science--and philosophy, so that's what you can expect to see here. Generally, the writing I do on the internet can be divided into 3 categories:

1. Tutorials 
2. Essays
3. Reflections

The writing isn't highly personal--I have a journal for that--regardless of the subject matter the aim of each post is to be useful or interesting to readers. My biggest inspiration is <a href="https://www.gwern.net/index">Gwern's Branwen's</a> blog.

If you have feedback for a post, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.

## Work
I'm a software engineer working at a startup called [Attentive](https://www.attentivemobile.com/). I'm on a data engineering team, working on bootstrapping our data pipelines and machine learning >:)

In the past, I've worked at Amazon Web Services on a product called [Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/), I've been a research assistant at a biomedical engineering lab out of Ohio State, and a freelance web developer. My experience is broad, ranging from machine learning to DevOps, to front end, and backend development. I've worked on and maintained a wide variety of projects at various scales; ranging from things like publicly facing AWS APIs with very high traffic and 24/7 on call, to mom-and-pop static websites and 1-off deep learning experiments.
